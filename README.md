# WhereToGo?
## Motiviation
I recently moved to Berlin for a new job and I would like to attend as many events as possible to get to know people, so I decided, as a developer, to write an application that checks which events are happening in Berlin during my free time and suggest them.

## Installation
### Tests
Tests are done using `pytest`. To install pytest
you have to install the developer dependencies via:
```python
pipenv install --dev
```

Afterwards you can run the tests via:
```python
python -m pytest tests/
```

## Usage
